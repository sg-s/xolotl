`xolotl` is a fast single-compartment and 
multi-compartment simulator  written in `C++` with 
a `MATLAB` interface that you'll actually enjoy using.

Why use xolotl? This is why:

-----------------

## xolotl is *FAST*

xolotl is written in C++, and it's **fast**. In our testing, it's 
more than **3 times** faster than NEURON for single
compartment neurons.

----------------
## xolotl is *easy to use*

Want to set up a Hodgkin-Huxley model, inject current, 
integrate it and plot the voltage trace? This is all you need:

```matlab
x = xolotl;
x.add('compartment', 'HH','A', 0.01);
x.HH.add('liu/NaV', 'gbar', 1000);
x.HH.add('liu/Kd', 'gbar', 300);
x.HH.add('Leak', 'gbar', 1);
x.I_ext = .2;
x.plot;
```


----------------

## xolotl has *documentation*

Unlike certain widely used NEURON simulators that 
shall remain nameless, xolotl has [documentation](https://xolotl.readthedocs.io) that actually...
exists. 

This is what it looks like:

----------------
## xolotl is fully *programmable*

xolotl is designed to be used from **within MATLAB**. It 
gives you the best of both worlds: the high performance 
of C++ compiled code with the rich power of all the toolboxes
MATLAB has to offer. You can:

* write functions that pass models as arguments
* optimize parameters of neuron models using the [Global Optimization Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html)
* run simulations in parallel across multiple computers
* have a single script to run the simulation and analyze results
