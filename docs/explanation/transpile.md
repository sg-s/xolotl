This document describes how xolotl automatically generates C++ code
that sets up and integrates a model, given a model specification in
MATLAB. 


## Philosophy

### How C++ objects are named and referenced

### How relationships between objects are inferred  

## Generating the C++ file

### How headers are resolved


### How objects are created

### How compartments are added

### How conductances are inserted into compartments

### How mechanisms are connected to objects

### How synapses are connected
