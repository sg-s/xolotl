Adding New Conductances/Synapses/Controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Look at existing conductances/synapses/controllers and use them as a guideline
* If you're making a new conductance, put them in ``c++/conductances/<first_author_name>``
* Make sure you add a reference to the paper you're getting the conductance details from in a comment at the top of the file
